# 2024 year in review

2024 was a hard year for us, but let's not dwell on that because 2025 is going to be a hard year for everybody. We persist.

- An article about us appeared in Street Roots. We love Street Roots.
- Party Line #9 was published, available from Microcosm Publishing.
- People went to ToorCamp.
- Three new public phones were installed, in Seattle, on SE Clinton, most importantly on NE Brazee, our first east of 82nd.
- An East Portland Action Plan Community Support Fund Grant provided support for the NE Brazee phone.

Usage for the year included:
