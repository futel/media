# Thank you to Multnomah County Library workers

We got a report about a temporarily disabled Futel phone from a Multnomah County Library administrator, who wrote, “I was checking the Futel phones closest to Woodstock library, as I want to make sure if we refer patrons for assistance, that the expected outcome happens.” Thank you to Multnomah County Library workers who are going to great lengths to support our community, and everyone who has reported on the conditions of Futel phones.
