Payphone continues it’s secondary purpose of collecting and displaying stickers. They started creeping over the parts that previously needed to be kept clear, and now the layers will accrete until the whole things is a barely recognizable blob.

This one isn’t even a bad thing. It’s in a San Francisco Mission bar, so microscopic particles from my body are in there, along with those of many others. It’s a repository of culture. And soon enough the entire thing will get pried off the wall. No archaeologist will scrape off and view the stickers, they will vaporize in the smelter. All the words that passed through it, the vibrations, electrons, the spit and breath, they only exist in the minds of we who are still thinking about them. And those minds will also eventually cease to convey. This device, this structure, it’s memorialized here, also temporarily. Probably these words are being read on a printed zine, a page which will decay and get recycled. Memento mori.
