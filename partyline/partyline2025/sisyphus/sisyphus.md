Druids of Sisyphus Log

Ah, 2024. A year of descent into the year 2025. As avowed sci-fi/fantasy nerds, the Druids have been warned about techno-fascist oligarchs and enshittification-fueled cyberpunk dystopias all their lives... but nothing could prepare them for how unsettling and petty the weird little billionaires could be. More than ever, we are seeking out any pocket universes for communication outside of the giant multinational e-commerce conglomerates, and human telephony connection.

- **2/14** Caller wished us a happy Valentine's Day.
- **3/07** Caller was curious about how many calls we get, and apologized for taking up our time.
- **4/24** Fellow millennial caller chatted about growing up with payphones. Said they found this phone "in the middle of nowhere". They were glad the concentration camp they tried calling was closed.
- **7/09** Caller asked about Druid life. Handed the receiver to their friend as I heard them say "it's really vague." I tried to be less vague in the conversation from then on, except when they asked if I like trap music.
- **7/28** Caller was a hopeful future Seattle Futel street phone host. They were testing out telephony services, and discussed some of our favorite menu items. Talked about furthering the conversation through other interfaces.
- **7/30** Voicemails while the Druids were out planting brassicas. One was someone peddling Druid crystals, the other was a bartender roughly 200 miles north of our location and wished us well in continuing to breathe fresh air.
- **8/02** Voicemail. Claimed to be a kid, "so I don't know what's going on. I don't know where my parents are" Left a second voicemail trying to call their own phone.
- **8/13** Caller was bummed to get our messaging machine. Left a nice voicemail: "The woods look good, the fog looks good, thank you for advocating for Palestine."
- **8/23** Friend caller on the Taylor street phone trying to make plans for a yet-unsuccessful visit, said they would try another Futel node, also unsuccessful.
- **9/15** Caller wanted to know what Futel is about.
- **10/29** Gave a vague answer to my location, wished each other happy Halloween.
- **10/29** Callers wanted to know if we were on a secret Druid cult compound in the woods. One caller was going as a romance novel cover model for Halloween.
- **11/1** Caller was an old friend, who called a mutual friend, who told them to call the Druids.
- **12/16** Caller was excited to find out about Futel and that it was near their location. They were grateful for the Druids as well.
