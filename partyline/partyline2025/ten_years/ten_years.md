# Ten Years of Futel

In 2014, we stuck a phone in the ground to see what would happen. In the ten years since then, we've put more phones in and taken some out. We've answered calls, helped people and been helped. We've had interesting conversations, listened patiently to some people and hung up on others. We've dug holes, ground off frozen bolts, sanitized handsets, and picked locks. We've experienced things coming down the line that we can't explain. And most importantly, we've continuously provided free telephone calls and telephone-mediated services.

What is Futel's future? Nobody knows, but we're doing at least some things right, so we will continue.
