2019 in review

2019 was, of course, a banner year for Futel operations!
- Three new phones were installed. Most notable was the first Detroit phone on Breckenridge St! Other locations were the parking lot of the Sou'wester Lodge in Seaview WA, and back in Portland on NE 8th Ave and at the bar of Upright Brewing, why not. This brings our inventory to ten public phones, plus the semipublic ones at the Upright and Right To Dream Too!
- We provided installation support for interactive shows by the Black Life Experiential Research Group and Patricia VÃ¡zquez, and the Hello Voyager project at Open Signal Fest.
- Funding was secured from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, a hefty individual donation, and of course from various people who support us on Patreon or allow themselves to be charmed into pressing small bills into our hands. Thanks!
- A program is in development in partnership with Open Signal. This is exciting because artists are already being paid to participate. Look for it in 2020.
- So many interviews, including on NPR and the Detroit Metro Times, which have started several conversations about future installations and programs.
- Wildcard Line episodes 5 and 6 were released. Contribute to the Wildcard Line from any Futel phone.
- Party Line #4 was published. Find back issues of Party Line at Microcosm Publishing.

Most importantly, we continued to provide services to our phones and incoming line, including:
11312 outgoing calls placed
376 calls to a randomly selected American concentration camp
326 calls to the Futel voice conference
142 Longmont Potion Castle experiences
92 uses of the the Payphone Demultiplexer
88 attempts to communicate with the Druid of Sissyphus Gardens
84 voicemail boxes created
76 calls to the mayor of Portland
16 calls to the mayor of Ypsilanti
