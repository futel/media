# HOSTILE TELECOM COMPANY VANDALIZES FUTEL INSTALLATION

## HIRED GOONS LEAVE LIBELOUS SCRAWL IN PATHETIC ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT SERVICE

Portland is home to several telecommunications companies besides Futel. While their shareholders envy our achievements, there have been no overtly antagonistic acts until April 2023, when uniformed representatives of a local telecom spray painted a threatening message on the sidewalk near our phone. The mercenary vandals then fled the scene in a company van.

This desperate attack on our infrastructure has failed. As propaganda, it is nonsensical. The signal is strong, which anyone can easily verify. As a threat, it is laughable. We have already demonstrated that our network cannot be stopped by the crowbars of thugs in the night.

Futelâ€™s users and operators are not dissuaded by this feeble attempt to compromise our service, and we remain resolute in the pursuit of our objectives.
