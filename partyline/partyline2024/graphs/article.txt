Outgoing phone calls manually entered at the dialtone per phone for 2023. Another crappy graph. We really just need to know when phones go down, everything else is kluged together. In order of popularity, Microcosm with almost 3,500, Central St., Taylor St., Breckenridge St., Pearl St., and the rest.Microcosm’s phone saw heavy use from the time it was installed. Central St. gets foot traffic, and Taylor St. has regular users. 23rd St. and Breckenridge St. in Detroit tends to rise and fall, but always gets a surprising rate of use, considering that it’s out of the way and in a depopulated zone. Cesar Chavez Blvd. also gets used a lot, it’s on a busy street that is not pedestrian-oriented but it is next to a bus stop.
