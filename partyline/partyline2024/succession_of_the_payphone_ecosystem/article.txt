I# Succession of the Telecom Ecosystem

The payphone is just one type of fruiting body in the telecommunications ecosystem. Most of the organism is underground, splayed out beneath the cities, and then the land and the sea. When one trunk dies the others shunt around it, but it takes such a long time to decay. It can take you places, but it gets kind of weird, so watch where you jack in. They call it the “dark fiber”.

A lot of the aboveground features converted with the networks, anything that handles money or tokens, ATMs, card readers, fare counters. When an interface doesn’t need to be maintained anymore - when the people who need it can be ignored - the devices are often left in place until they get destroyed. This fire/emergency call box in San Francisco was a PSTN phone. The phone was yanked out, but the wires are still there underground.
