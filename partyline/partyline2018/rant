The typical first world urban surface dweller interacts with several
computers a day, and one could be forgiven for categorizing these into
two types: those belonging to their users, and those belonging to someone
else. This is, however, a foolish distinction. Any networked device is
a tool designed to fulfill the objectives of its user only so far as
they fulfill the objectives of those who own the network. And any
manufactured object, whether
considered public or private, is built upon a vast industrial
foundation. We see only the part that's pointed at us, not the layers
upon layers beneath, but they are there, and they are largely made out
of people.

The most common computing device used by the modern eloi is, of course, the
pocket telephone. What do you see when you observe the river of people
interacting with their supposedly personal phones? Whose desires are being pursued?

At Futel, we believe we have found a way for those layers of
technology and the people who service them to work for us. If we can
help you find the answers to this important question, we invite you to
consider the interests of our network to be aligned with your own. By
our works shall you know us.
