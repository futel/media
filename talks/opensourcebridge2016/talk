-- name addresses
-- a little behind because I went to Europe
   here are payphones from Paris, Budapest, and Prague
   Also went to Amsterdam, but there were no payphones there!
   Why were there no payphones there?
   I rarely left the rich section of the city, but Prague was horribly touristy
   and had payphones.
   There are still payphones in Portland, though, here and there.

- 1: what is futel?
-- we are providing free telephony services to the public

- 2: first, some background: phreakers
-- hacker subculture exploiting the phone system
-- manipulated the phone network
--- free calls
--- just to do it - routing calls, exploiting equipment
-- parasites, exploiting the technology of the man
-- stealing from the war machine
-- or just to get free stuff
   also noble if you think society is evil
-- all sorts of justifications for theft of services
--- everybody hates the phone company!
    and back then, it was just The Phone Company, Ma Bell, AT&T
-- but mainly, exploring technology, hacking for the sake of hacking.
   We live inside a machine!
-- fun to make the machines do things!
-- nowadays, phreaker culture has pretty much evaporated into hacker culture,
   there's more to hack out there!  But people still collect and abuse
   equipment.

- 3: what is futel?
-- we are two developers and several contributors
-- we are a phone company!
-- we are sticking phones in public places and not charging for them
-- services, all free, include
--- domestic calls
--- voicemail
--- operator on call and other human communication
--- one-touch dialing to the mayor
--- random payphone ringing
--- art, interactive things to do
---- radiation meter
---- Nintendo
---- planned audio/communication artist features, audio zines, etc.
-- we are not phreaking in that we're not manipulating someone else's
   infratructure
-- we aren't even hacking in a black or white hat sense
   we're not tresspassing on anyone's network
-- we're buying service and giving it away, we're customers!  Sorry, boring!
-- but we are social hackers.
   How will people use this?
   How can we help and confuse people?
-- Really, we just miss phones.
-- but also, we're living in a time of awesome individual geek power
--- a small group of nerds with a little money and time can create things that
    used to take a lot of infrastructure
--- it makes you want to do something!
--- if we had more common sense, we'd be rich, instead, we're deploying
    a phone network
-- I should mention a little about how we do it
--- we run an asterisk VOIP server on a cheap cloud box
--- asterisk speaks SIP
--- we have little SIP boxes we get used for cheap
--- phones plug into SIP boxes on one end, ethernet on the other end
--- SIP boxes talk to Linksys routers running DD-WRT running OpenVPN
--- routers tunnel that SIP to a DigitalOcean box which is our OpenVPN server
--- that tunnels to another DO box which runs our Asterisk VOIP server
--- Asterisk box talks the SIP trunk we buy service from
--- Asterisk is old and well used but horrible
--- also the trick with these SIP boxes is avoiding locked ones
--- in general the software is horrible and the proprietary hardware annoying
--- anyway, the technical overview is, we have three DigitalOcean boxes covering
    our cloud prod and stage infrastructure, with one-button building of an
    installation or promoting stage to prod, and a less automated but still
    boilerplate system to turn a phone, a SIP box, and a Linksys router into
    a full phone installation

5: why is futel? motivation for starting a phone company
-- motivation: discover and illustrate meaning behind tech of everyday life
--- gotta be public, gotta be urban, gotta be accessible
---- we don't just deploy at festivals, we're on the streets
-- motivation: fascination with public kiosks and interactive street hardware
   the Finn
-- zines
--- audiozines, the Apology Line
--- participatory technology
-- motivation: lawnmower guy who couldn't keep phone charged
-- motivation: clinton street cadillacs
--- connectivity is something that's cheap for us to provide
-- motivation: turn discards into useful or interesting things
--- why? because the world is fucked up and we don't necessarily belong here
    no better way to reinforcd that than to wallow in trash
--- why? skillz
-- motivation: keep temporarily obsolete technology alive
--- why? probably won't be obsolete forever
--- why? skillz
- motivation: build something that encourages people to be sincere
-- we can be cynical and even obnoxious without being mean
- motivation: must keep busy
-- I personally get real down when I'm idle
-- I never can tell when a project is going to be realistic, and I tend to
   find myself deep in it when it's too late to back out
-- kind of a recurring theme, practical jokes that are largely played on myself
-- but I want to emphasize that there is one core reason for Futel, and that
   is to provide phone service to anyone who might want it

6: conclusion
- we are starting a phone company because we don't really have a choice
