Title:

Futel: The Payphone, Devolved

Abstract:

Part public service and part public art, Futel is keeping payphones alive by installing them in public locations and providing free telephone service, telephone-mediated art, and live human interaction.

We feel that the constraints of the phone interface spur creativity, pay homage to a generation of creative hackers, and allow us to worm our way into the minds of large groups of people.

Now that we are finally living in the cyberpunk dystopia promised in the 80s, we are poised to seize this moment. What aspects of the project make it effective, and how can we apply them to other creative technological projects?

Bio:

Karl Anderson is a hardware and software experimenter who is good at thinking up projects but bad at predicting whether or not they will be practical. As director of Futel, he runs Portland's fastest-growing payphone network. With C.H.U.N.K. 666, he has created amphibious human-powered vehicles out of discarded bicycles and construction debris. With the Church of Robotron, he has built a post-apocalyptic training facility, indoctrination center, and reading room based on the tenets of a coin-operated video game.
