I am the operator of Futel, Portland's fastest-growing network of telephones firmly attached to the surface of the Earth, providing free calls, access to services, human interaction, and confusing experiences. Other projects, all of which also involve the public use of technology diverted from the waste stream, include the Church of Robotron and C.H.V.N.K. 666.
