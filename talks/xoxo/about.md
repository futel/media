# One minute intro

For XOXO, I propose a talk and/or an installation.


# Presentation

Part public service and part public art, Futel is keeping the payphone alive by installing them in public locations and offering free calls and interactive audio experiences. Why do we do it? Is it sustainable?

Now that we are finally living in the cyberpunk dystopia promised in the 80s, we are poised to seize this moment. What aspects of the project make it effective, and how can we apply them to other creative technological projects? Which constraints give us the freedom to use our abilities to effect change, or at least confuse people?

A talk with speaker and slides, ideally 30-60 minutes.
For previous experience, including 9 talks:

### Outline

This is a description of Futel and an extrapolation which
covers the social economics ('emotional labor') and dynamics of technological
art projects. Why are we creative with technology? How do we make our creativity
sustainable?

# Installation

One or more Futel phones, creating an interesting, apocalyptic, and egalitarian
