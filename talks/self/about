Gird Your Neighborhood With Our Telephones Of Steel

abstract

Part public service project and part public art installation, Futel is keeping payphones alive by rescuing them from the recycler and installing them in public locations, where they provide free calls, interactive experiences, and live operator assistance.

Why do we do it? Is our work sustainable? What aspects of the project make it effective, and how can these ideas be applied to other projects? Some of these questions will be answered, and some will only lead to further questions, but along the way, I will discuss our approach to technological art and how the constraints of our interfaces give us the freedom to reach, or at least confuse people.
