description

Futel has provided free public telephone service, telephone-mediated art, and live human interaction for several years, and was recognized as Portlandâ€™s most prolific payphone installer of 2016. Why do we do it? Is it sustainable?

Now that we are finally living in the cyberpunk dystopia promised in the 80s, we are poised to seize this moment. What aspects of the project make it effective, and how can we apply them to other creative technological projects, whether physical or on the net? Which constraints give us the freedom to use our abilities to effect change, or at least confuse people and delay boredom?
