Futel Telephone Sanitizer Handbook
==

Congratulations! You have chosen or have been chosen to serve your community as a Futel telephone sanitizer! To succeed at your role, you will need to always follow these simple guidelines.

# Read this first

Keep yourself and your family safe! Telephone sanitization can be performed safely and should not put you at risk of infection, but if you are immunocompromised or do not feel safe performing these duties, contact your handler.

# Telephone Sanitizer Guidelines

The purpose of telephone sanitation is primarily to improve the health and safety of Futel users, and secondarily to assure Futel users that the phones are safe to use.

Sanitize the telephone and hand washing station (if so equipped) as often as feasible, and at least daily.

You have received:
- A sanitization solution spray bottle
- A sponge
- A set of latex, nitrile, or rubber gloves
- A sticker packet
- These instructions

Keep all of these items in a storage container such as a grocery bag, away from children. Don't touch them when not in use.

# Sanitization Preparation Procedure

Wash your hands. Put on gloves.

# Telephone Sanitization Procedure

With handset still in cradle, spray solution directly on all exposed parts of handset.

Remove handset from cradle. Spray solution directly on all parts of handset except receiver and transmitter, taking care to not spray directly into receiver and transmitter holes.

Spray solution on sponge until moist. Wipe handset receiver and transmitter with sponge. Wipe any visible grime from handset with sponge.

Spray solution directly on keypad, coin return lever, and coin return hopper cover. Wipe any visible grime from keypad, coin return lever, and coin return cover with sponge. Replace handset.

Write date and your handle on sanitization sticker. Your handle can be your name or whatever identifier you choose.  Apply sticker to telephone or enclosure in conspicuous location.

# Hand Washing Station Sanitization Procedure

Spray solution directly on spigot and soap dispenser.

Fill water tank.

Write date and your handle on sanitization sticker. Your handle can be your name or whatever identifier you choose. Apply sticker to station in conspicuous location.

# Sanitization Cleanup Procedure.

Rinse sponge in water.

Return all cleaning supplies to container.

Remove gloves. Return rubber gloves to container if so equipped. Dispose of latex or nitrile gloves if so equipped. Wash hands.

Stow container.

Note any low sanitization supply levels, and report to your handler, or replace them.

Note any low hand washing station supply levels, and report to your handler, or replace them.

Report any damage or grime which prevents sanitization or use to your handler.

# Safety Notes

If eye protection is not worn, care must be taken to protect eyes and mucous membranes from direct contact with disinfectant. Flush eyes and face with water after contact.

Sanitization can be performed safely without gloves if hands are properly washed after procedure.

# Supply notes

Feel free to use the supplies for the safety of yourself and your family if you need them. The cheapest sanitizing solution is a 10% bleach solution in water. Higher concentrations of bleach do not increase effectiveness. A Pine-Sol solution is also economical when used as directed for sanitation. Many other products including alcohol wipes and various disinfectants can also be used.

# Motivational notes

Thank you! You will find your service as a Futel telephone sanitizer to be rewarding and fulfilling. If you can, send a picture of the telephone being sanitized!
