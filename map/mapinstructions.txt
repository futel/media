The current print/graphic map is in:
media/map/vector-map

The three indesign files contain the different maps to export. The maps are built up from illustrator assets in “assets.” update the assets then let indesign files relink. Export service-map.indd and service-map8-5x11.indd as print pdfs. Export service-map-web.indd adn Service-map as PNGs. 

There are additional icons in the “icons” folder. Screenshots of OSM map files that were traced are in “sources.”

How to update the uMap embedded map:
add locations to umapfutel.csv
media/map/umapfutel.csv

upload this file to uMap (link below) and check “replace layer content” on Layer 1

The map was built with my openstreetmap login (MathewL)

there is a second map because uMap broke Github login for a bit.

How to update the InDesign map:
I use Stamen’s OpenStreetMap toner tileset so that it is 1) creative commons and 2)  prints well.  Their map viewer has a built-in image export and embed functions:
