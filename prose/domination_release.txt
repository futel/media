Dear zir/sir/mz/madam,
After being referred to by a national paper of record as “some guy in Portland who put a phone in his front yard,” Futel is reaching out to clear up misconceptions regarding North America’s largest network of free pay phones.

1. Futel is not now nor has ever been “some guy.” Futel is a 501(c)3 charitable organization fully staffed for telecommunications service. Network and maintenance technicians, operators, phone hosts, and callers are coordinated through appropriate bureaucratic mechanisms and infrastructure.
2. While Futel began in Portland with one phone, Futel now serves four cities in three states with a network of fourteen phones (see provided service map).
3. Front yards are not the only places Futel phones can be found. Service is also provided in alleys, temporary and permanent encampments, building exteriors, and even the insides of buildings.

Futel callers placed over 14,000 calls last year. All calls from Futel phones are free in continental North America. Sound art and interactive audio projects are available within the Futel phone menu. Operators are sometimes standing by.  

All people and organizations can host Futel phones. Open source repositories of Futel software, documentation, and operations are available. Collaborations are welcomed. Inspired independent telecoms are encouraged to take up the cause.

Futel’s relentless expansion devours broken and uprooted phones, regurgitating functional fixtures that return telephony to its rightful place in the public sphere— available at any time to anyone, without restriction. Please report the truth: Futel’s expansion is unstoppable, Futel’s righteousness undeniable, and Futel’s dominance inevitable. 

Questions may be directed to Futel operators: (503) 468-1337 ext. 0.

Thank you,

FUTEL
